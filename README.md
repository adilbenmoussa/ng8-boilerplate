## What's in the box ?

### Commitizen

[commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is a command line utility that makes it easier to create commit messages following the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification.

Use ```git cz``` instead of ```git commit``` to use commitizen.

[![Add and commit with Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/raw/master/meta/screenshots/add-commit.png)](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/raw/master/meta/screenshots/add-commit.png)


### Commitlint

[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:
```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional
```
Are you a good `commitizen` ?
